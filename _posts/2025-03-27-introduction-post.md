Welcome to the Open Trade Project!

## Why I Started This Blog

I’ve always wanted a space to document my adventures—whether they’re coding experiments, random musings, or just life updates. Jekyll seemed like the perfect tool: lightweight, customizable, and no databases to fuss over. Plus, the Chirpy theme makes it look sleek without me breaking a sweat.

Here's my blog link: [Link Text]([URL](https://x.com/AndyHermanNFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor))

## What to Expect

Here's something I changed just to creat a new blog post:

- **Tech Stuff**: Bits of code, tutorials, or whatever I’m tinkering with.
- **Random Thoughts**: Life, the universe, and everything in between.
- **Fun Media**: Maybe a photo or two, like this one:

_My current desk setup where all the magic (and coffee spills) happen._

## Let’s Connect

Feel free to drop a comment below (if I’ve got that set up right) or find me on Twitter. Here’s to more posts and less procrastination!

Cheers,
