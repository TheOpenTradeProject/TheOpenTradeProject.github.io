## Welcome to the Open Trade Project!

Iâ€™ve always been interested in data analysis and how it applies to the roster building aspects of NFL teams, and draft season is one of my favorite parts of the year. The league is increasingly paying attention to data science, as evidenced by NFL Next Gen Stats and Pro Football Focus. The internet is full of mock drafts and projectionsn and I wanted to contribute in some way.

Scouting prospects is a highly subjective process; each team has its own priorities and athletic requirements, and we'll never know what happens inside war rooms. I wanted to stay away from speculating and projecting players as much as possible. Eventually, I had an idea: how to reimagine the current NFL trade chart using modern data analysis techniques? The result is The Open Trade Project.

Over the past few months, I have gathered data for all NFL draft trades since 2002 (when the current format was established). I evaluated the trades using the classic Jimmy Johnson model and added uncertainty to the value of each pick using machine learning. I also developed an open, free-to-use [draft trade grader](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TheOpenTradeProject/Sample_Draft_Grader).

This post is an overview of the project. In the upcoming weeks, further posts will take a deep dive on specific aspects.

Trades for the 2025 NFL Draft will be graded live [here](https://x.com/TheOpenTrade/).
